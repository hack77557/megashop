To get the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, follow these steps to use Stripe's Webhook feature. This secret is required for listening to and verifying events triggered by Stripe when payments or related actions occur.

### Steps to get `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:

1. **Install Stripe CLI**:

   - To set up webhook listeners locally, you need the Stripe CLI tool.
   - Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system here: [Stripe CLI installation guide](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install).

   For example:

   - **macOS (via Homebrew)**:
     ```bash
     brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
     ```
   - **Linux (via apt)**:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://stripe.com/install-cli | sudo bash
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     You can download the installer from [Stripe CLI for Windows](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest/download/stripe.exe).

2. **Log in to Stripe CLI**:
   After installation, log in to the CLI using your Stripe account:

   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

   This will open a browser window for you to log in to your Stripe account.

3. **Listen to Stripe Webhook Events**:
   After logging in, you need to set up the webhook listener to receive events from Stripe. This is done using the `stripe listen` command:

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payment/stripe-webhook/
   ```

   Here, `localhost:8000/payment/stripe-webhook/` should be your local Django application URL that handles Stripe's webhook events (as per the project's setup).

4. **Get the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`**:
   When you run the `stripe listen` command, it will output something like this:

   ```bash
   > Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_***************
   ```

   - The `whsec_***************` is your `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Copy this value and add it to your `.env` file as:
     ```bash
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_***************
     ```

5. **Configure the Webhook Endpoint on Stripe Dashboard (Optional)**:
   If you want to set up a webhook for production or a remote server (not local), you can configure your webhook endpoint directly on the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks).

   - Go to the **Developers > Webhooks** section.
   - Click on **Add Endpoint**.
   - Set the URL where you want to listen for Stripe events (for example, `http://<public IP>/payment/stripe-webhook/`).
   - After setting it up, you can view the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from the dashboard.

---

### Summary:

Once you run the `stripe listen` command, you'll see your `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (starting with `whsec_`), which you can then use in your `.env` file. Youâ€™re ready to listen for and process Stripe payment events locally.
